# UFOs

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this was to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Then, create filters to make this table fully dynamic and will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. The data being used is for UFO Sightings during the first two weeks of January in the year 2010.

## Results
The results are a web app that filtes the UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape. You input the proper criteria here in the input table shown below. For example you would enter the date "01/06/2010" into where it says "Enter Date":

and the results would reveal the the following:

The values are autopopulated to make it easier for the user to know how to use it. Furthermore, the layout of the web app came out well using bg-dark to format the page:
