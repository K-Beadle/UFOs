# UFOs

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this was to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Then, create filters to make this table fully dynamic and will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. The data being used is for UFO Sightings during the first two weeks of January in the year 2010.

## Results
The results are a web app that filters the UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape. You input the proper criteria here in the input table shown below. For example, you would enter the date "01/06/2010" into where it says "Enter Date":

and the results would reveal the following:

The values are auto populated to make it easier for the user to know how to use it. Furthermore, the layout of the web app came out well using bg-dark to format the page:

## Summary

One drawback of this webpage is that it does not allow you to search for a sighting by the duration that it was observed. Although the data is not overwhelmingly large, it would be useful to filter by all sightings that occurred for more than 30 minutes or more than 1 hour letâ€™s say. 

- The first recommendation I would make is to add another filter to allow users to filter by the total duration of the sighting.

- The second recommendation I would make is to gather additional data. It is quite interesting to see so many sightings listed to search and filter through; however, it only has data for the first two weeks of one month from 10 years ago. I recommend gathering more data and possibly merging multiple sources together to have a much larger time frame on the available data to filter through.
